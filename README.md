# jabberbot

Jabberbot is a Telegram bot that loads plugins. That's about it. Check the `plugins/` directory to see some examples.

Jabberbot requires Python 3.5 or higher.

### Install

Adjust the following for your operating system:

    $ sudo dnf install python3-devel ffmpeg
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -r requirements-plugins.txt

Now put your Telegram API key in a file called `token` in the same directory at `jabberbot.py` and you're all set. Have fun.
