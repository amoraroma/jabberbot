# jabberbot

JabberBot is a Telegram bot that loads plugins. That's about it. Check the `plugins/` directory to see some examples.

### Install

    $ sudo dnf install python3-devel
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Now put your Telegram API key in a file called `token` in the same directory at `jabberbot.py` and you're all set. Have fun.

### Run

    $ python3.5 jabberbot.py
