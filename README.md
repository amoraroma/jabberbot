# jabberbot

Jabberbot is a Telegram bot that loads plugins. That's about it. Check the `plugins/` directory to see some examples.

Jabberbot requires Python 3.5 or higher.

### Install

Adjust the following for your operating system:

    $ sudo dnf install python3-devel ffmpeg
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -r requirements-plugins.txt

Now put your Telegram API key in a file called `token` in the same directory at `jabberbot.py` and you're all set. Have fun.

### Run

    $ python3.5 jabberbot.py

### Training cobe

To train cobe, simply place a file named `train.txt` containing your training text in `data/cobe/`. This file will be used to train cobe then renamed (to something similar to `train.txt.0`). Only a file named `train.txt` will be used to train cobe, so don't worry about these backups.
