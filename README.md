# jabberbot

JabberBot is a Markov-chain chat bot for Telegram that listens for audio messages and reponds to them with its own audio messages.

### Install

    $ sudo dnf install python3-devel
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Now put your Telegram API key in a file called `token` in the same directory at `jabberbot.py` and you're all set. Have fun.
